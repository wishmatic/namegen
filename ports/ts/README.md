# `character-namegen` NPM Package

RPG name generator with a decently good (in our opinion) IRL name generator.

## Install

```sh
npm install character-namegen
# ...or
pnpm add character-namegen
# ...or
yarn add character-namegen
# ...or
bun add character-namegen
```

## Usage

For example:

```ts
import { generate, Female } from "character-namegen";

const generated = generate(Female);
// => { givenName, surname, gender }
```

`generate(gender?, culture?)`: an empty gender or a `null` culture is resolved at random.

### Types

- `Gender` (`"male" | "female" | "non-binary"`), with `Male`, `Female`, `NonBinary` constants
- `Name{ givenName, surname: string; gender: Gender }`
- `Culture`, `IRLCulture`, `PhonemeCulture`; `SUPPORTED_CULTURES`, `IRL_CULTURES`, `PHONEME_CULTURES`
